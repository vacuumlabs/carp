# Client API

TBD: NPM link

We provide a Typescript client for ease of use from Javascript, we also provide an OpenAPI / Swagger definition. This helps with

- Writing clients for other languages
- Having human-readable documentation for the API

You can find the OpenAPI / swagger definition [here](/openapi)
