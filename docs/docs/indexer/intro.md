# Introduction

The core idea of Carp is to be fast & modular. We achieve this by allowing you to only run the indexing logic that you need for your specific application.

We achieve this using what we call _Execution Plans_. Execution plans are `.ini` files that specify which tasks need to be run for your specific indexer needs. Carp will handle the execution of these graphs for you so that independent tasks run in parallel to maximize speed.
