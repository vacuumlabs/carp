# SQL Format

Although Carp comes with a webserver and client, users may want to run their own SQL queries.

Here is the table format used by Carp

![schema](../../bin/sql-graph.svg)

More concretely, the full SQL schema can be seen below

<CodeBlock language="sql" title="schema.sql" showLineNumbers>
  {SqlFile}
</CodeBlock>
